With so much money at stake, the major game publishers are hugely incentivized to create the next big hit. But are games getting better, or has the golden age of video games already passed?\n","\n","In this project, you'll analyze video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. You'll search for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and you'll explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.\n","\n","Your search will involve joining datasets and comparing results with set theory. You'll also filter, group, and order data. Make sure you brush up on these skills before trying this project! The database contains two tables. Each table has been limited to 400 rows for this project, but you can find the complete dataset with over 13,000 games on Kaggle.\n","\n","### `game_sales` table\n","\n","| Column | Definition | Data Type |\n","|-|-|-|  \n","|name|Name of the video game|`varchar`|\n","|platform|Gaming platform|`varchar`|\n","|publisher|Game publisher|`varchar`|\n","|developer|Game developer|`varchar`|\n","|games_sold|Number of copies sold (millions)|`float`|\n","|year|Release year|`int`|\n","\n","### `reviews` table\n","\n","| Column | Definition | Data Type |\n","|-|-|-|\n","|name|Name of the video game|`varchar`|  \n","|critic_score|Critic score according to Metacritic|`float`|\n","|user_score|User score according to Metacritic|`float`|\n","\n","\n","### `users_avg_year_rating` table\n","\n","| Column | Definition | Data Type |\n","|-|-|-|\n","|year| Release year of the games reviewed |`int`|  \n","|num_games| Number of games released that year |`int`|\n","|avg_user_score| Average score of all the games ratings for the year |`float`|\n","\n","### `critics_avg_year_rating` table\n","\n","| Column | Definition | Data Type |\n","|-|-|-|\n","|year| Release year of the games reviewed |`int`|  \n","|num_games| Number of games released that year |`int`|\n","|avg_critic_score| Average score of all the games ratings for the year |`float`|\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"1216acd5-e067-4582-be43-23907fce4bf3","metadata":{"customType":"sql","dataFrameVariableName":"best_selling_games","sqlCellMode":"dataFrame","sqlSource":{"integrationId":"89e17161-a224-4a8a-846b-0adc0fe7a4b1","integrationType":"postgresql","type":"integration"},"vscode":{"languageId":"sql"}},"outputs":[],"source":["-- best_selling_games\n","-- Find the top ten best selling games of all time.\n","-- Return all the columns from the table but only the top ten best selling games.\n","SELECT *\n","FROM game_sales\n","ORDER BY games_sold DESC\n","LIMIT 10;"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"e2148652-a2e1-43fa-9d50-d384d22842d1","metadata":{"customType":"sql","dataFrameVariableName":"critics_top_ten_years","sqlCellMode":"dataFrame","sqlSource":{"integrationId":"89e17161-a224-4a8a-846b-0adc0fe7a4b1","integrationType":"postgresql","type":"integration"},"vscode":{"languageId":"sql"}},"outputs":[],"source":["-- golden_years\n","-- Find the golden years of video games, based on the user and critic reviews.\n","-- Returning the golden years of video games.\n","SELECT u.year AS year, \n","    u.num_games AS num_games, \n","    c.avg_critic_score AS avg_critic_score, \n","    u.avg_user_score AS avg_user_score,\n","    (u.avg_user_score - c.avg_critic_score) AS diff\n","FROM critics_avg_year_rating AS c\n","INNER JOIN users_avg_year_rating AS u\n","ON c.year = u.year\n","WHERE c.avg_critic_score > 9 OR u.avg_user_score > 9\n","ORDER BY year ASC;"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"e08b19dc-1c07-44d3-ba2d-bfef848cb6b3","metadata":{"customType":"sql","dataFrameVariableName":"golden_years","sqlCellMode":"dataFrame","sqlSource":{"integrationId":"89e17161-a224-4a8a-846b-0adc0fe7a4b1","integrationType":"postgresql","type":"integration"},"vscode":{"languageId":"sql"}},"outputs":[],"source":["-- golden_years\n","-- Find the golden years of video games, based on the user and critic reviews.\n","-- Returning the golden years of video games.\n","SELECT u.year AS year, \n","    u.num_games AS num_games, \n","    c.avg_critic_score AS avg_critic_score, \n","    u.avg_user_score AS avg_user_score,\n","    (u.avg_user_score - c.avg_critic_score) AS diff\n","FROM critics_avg_year_rating AS c\n","INNER JOIN users_avg_year_rating AS u\n","ON c.year = u.year\n","WHERE c.avg_critic_score > 9 OR u.avg_user_score > 9\n","ORDER BY u.year ASC;"]}],"metadata":{"editor":"DataCamp Workspace","kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
